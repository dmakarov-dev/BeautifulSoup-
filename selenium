from selenium import webdriver

url = 'https://example.com'

# Set the path to your chromedriver executable
driver_path = '/path/to/chromedriver'

# Create a new instance of the Chrome driver
driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=driver_path)

# Navigate to the URL
driver.get(url)

# Wait for a few seconds to allow JavaScript to execute (you may need to adjust this)
driver.implicitly_wait(5)

# Get the page source after JavaScript has executed
page_source = driver.page_source

# Close the browser
driver.quit()

# Now, you can use BeautifulSoup to parse the page_source as before
soup = BeautifulSoup(page_source, 'html.parser')

# Continue with parsing and extracting information from the page
